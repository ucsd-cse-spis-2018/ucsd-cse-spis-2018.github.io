Please use the same repo you use for your other [homework](/hwk/h01/). In a file named aps1.md, write a solution to [these problems](/hwk/aps1/aps1problems.pdf).

(If you prefer, you can submit an aps1.pdf created with latex instead - here's the [latex source for the problems](https://www.overleaf.com/read/bjvnzgtxjnfd) to get you started.)

You may find it helpful to refer to the [slides from class](/hwk/aps1/aps1NotesAug9.pptx). If you do not have PowerPoint installed, as a student you can get it for free [here](https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education) or use the web-based version [here](https://office.live.com/start/PowerPoint.aspx).
