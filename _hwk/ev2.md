# Enrichment Videos

The enrichment videos this week introduce you to two women who made big contributions to the history of computing.  Watch these two videos:

* [Great Minds: Katherine Johnson](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DBdr9QBRcPEk&sa=D&ust=1534186651719000&usg=AFQjCNGeTl_wZCfp0O5IKqo0v5-NvI-woQ)		
* [Great Minds: Margaret Hamilton](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DPPLDZMjgaf8&sa=D&ust=1534186651719000&usg=AFQjCNE_yVfoxrK-4KQg85Tmdhg9Uoiq-w)

Then do some research to find another person from history who had an influence in computing in any way (large or small), who is of interest to you.  Find a website and/or video that talks about that person to learn a bit about them and their influence in computing.

Finally, enter your responses to the questions in [this Google form](https://goo.gl/forms/loyF1PvTA7vBSs9G2).
