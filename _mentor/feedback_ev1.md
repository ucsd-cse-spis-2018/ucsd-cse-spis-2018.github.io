You should provide feedback on their response to their first enrichment video soon after the deadline, which is Thursday at 9am.  The goal of this feedback is to acknolwedge their work and respond to their comments.

# Finding their response

Unlike the labs, responses to the enrichment videos will not be in github.  Instead you will find them in this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V4F-vsUxo2zfqZwPUINP9wTTEYViLgkE?usp=sharing).  You can either use the form itself or the responses spreadsheet to look at their responses.

# Responding to their response

Under the appropriate heading in the feedback document in their feedback repository, put your response to what they wrote.  Here's what you should comment on (all of the following):

* Comment on what the found surprising/interesting.  Do you agree?
* (Optional) Are you also interested in the topics they selected?  Let them know, and share your excitement.
* Look at the URL they provided.  Is it meaningful?  Do you have other suggestions for where they could learn more?  Leave them in your feedback.  If the URL is not a great source, help them understand how to find better sources.  If it is, congratulate them on finding a great site.  This is your chance to help them find high quality resources.
* Read about what they learned.  Is it well-thought out?  Great!  Respond to it and tell them that. If it's not, ask them to say a bit more.  Encourage them to think deeply.

Overall, we'll looking to support well-thought-out answers and to encourage students who are not giving us quite enough to give us a bit more.  Stay positive, and help them get excited about thinking deeply about computing.
