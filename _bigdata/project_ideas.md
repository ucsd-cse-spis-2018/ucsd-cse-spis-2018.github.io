[Lab 7](/labs/lab07) gave you a taste of machine learning, applied specifically to the domain of text classification and text generation.  At the bottom of that lab there are some ideas for extensions you can implement for your project.  But if you're looking for even more ideas, here's what we recommend.

Here are some general ideas for directions you might go.  See the linked website below for specific guidance on many of these:
* Choose a different data set (text or otherwise) and perform some classification (using Naive Bayes or another classifier).  We've linked some [possible data sets here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MTV7qL_siAVdsbfis0K_KfBQKXnZdc9p6KAbga5hrVM/edit?usp=sharing), or many more are linked to from the link below.
* Learn how to use the scikit.learn library to apply another classifier to the data from Lab 7, or another data set.
* Implement a clustering or classification algorithm from scratch.

For structured guidance, we highly recommend you follow the ideas and instructions on this page, which provides 8 hands-on machine learning projects for beginners: <https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-projects-for-beginners>
